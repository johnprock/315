Section 1 Purpose:
This project is a tool to help maximize procrastination. The goal is to schedule activities during freetime which would 
otherwise be wasted by the user. The activities are selected randomly by the application to fill unused time. The system
will use a super-uuber simplistic database to manage the different users and the activities that they are involved in.


Sectction 2 High Level Entities:

App:
  the app user interface

Database Engine:
  The module does the actual manipulation of the database file based on the instructions recieved from the parser. It consists of a single class object.

Lexer
  This module tokenizes a string of SQL commands from the user application into tokens that can be used by the parser.

Parser
  This module checks the simplistic SQL syntax of the token stream and then calls the Database Engine functions to exectue
  the commands.

Data Model
  ...
  
Section 3 Low Level Design:

App design:

Engine design:
  Class DB_Engine
    Members:
      Open_Files - a vector containing all of the file descriptors opened by the database engine.
    Functions:
      Open()
      Close()
      Write()
      Exit()
      Show()
      Create()
      Update()
      Insert()
      Delete()
      Select()
      Project()
      Rename()
      Operator+()
      Operator-()
      Operator*()

Data Model:

Section 4 Benefits, assumptions, risks/issues:

Benefits:
The database is very simple. It should be easy to build and maintain.

Assumptions:
Assuming that the simplistic database will be robust enough to meet the needs of our application.
We are assuming that we will be able to invent activities for our procrastination app.
...

Risks:
The data is stored in plaintext. This makes the dabase insecure and vunerable to attack.
