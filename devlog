Project: Grocery List Application

The basic application will have three functions: Create List, Delete list, and Show Lists.
After this is implemented we can add functions like Edit list. The application will make calls
directly to the dbEngine. This will be a terminal application.

Example:

user# ./listapp
Type 1 for Create List.
Type 2 for Delete List.
Type 3 for Show Lists.
-->



There is a root menu that asks for a basic action. Each action opens a submenu with a dialogue
for that action. Our application should have one Database object. Each list should be a table in this database.
Since our parser isn't functioning, our application won't have persistant storage. The root menu and application
layout should be completed by tomorrow night. The application will be a class. Each action is a function within
the class. 

Ben     -- Create
Patrick -- Delete
JuAnne  -- Show
